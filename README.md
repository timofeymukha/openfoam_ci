![example workflow](https://github.com/timofeymukha/openfoam_ci/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)

Demonstrating how one can use CI tools to test openfoam code compilation.
There is a workflow for Github Actions and Cirrus CI included, both test compiling a dummy application with `wmake`.

Thanks to Alberto Passalacqua for helping with this!
